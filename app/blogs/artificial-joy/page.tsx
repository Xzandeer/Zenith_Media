            Would you ask someone to get out of the pool while they’re having so much fun,
            even if they just jumped in a few minutes ago?
          </p>

          <p>
            <i>Would you let them enjoy the water or save them from its depths?</i>
          </p>

          <p>
            The same thing keeps happening in our family—my sister initiating the AI-assisted
            image generation, and my parents rejoicing every result fed to them, leaving me
            with the dilemma of whether to cut their happiness short or just let them be.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, it’s getting out of hand—they use such scarily altered images as their
            display photos and brag about them in their profiles with a
            <b> #feelingblessed </b> caption.
            <br />
            But blessed who, exactly?
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">
            Who benefits from these AI-generated images with real people’s faces plastered
            on a robot’s canvas, apart from our distorted perception of beauty?
          </h3>

          <p>
            This emerging technological epidemic, disguised as casual entertainment, reveals
            a gap in awareness about the real dangers of AI.
          </p>

          <p>
            According to Howarth (2025), AI usage increased by 84.58% during the previous
            12 months—ChatGPT alone accumulated 5.4 billion visits every month as of August
            this year. In a more localized context, Google’s Gemini has also made a noise
            in the Philippines due to its newly introduced image generation feature.
          </p>

          <p>
            Reyes (2025) reported that Filipinos are the top users of generative AI,
            generating 25.5 million images in just a few days. It’s wild how trends work
            in the Philippines, especially AI prompts and creations, as Filipinos tend to
            be always online—quickly jumping from one trend to another.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, it’s also alarming to know that, as easy as it is to upload a photo
            to an AI server out of curiosity driven by a trend, anyone can also be a victim.
            That is why having family members who actively engage in such image generation
            worries me.
          </p>

          <p>
            Not only do these AI services contribute to environmental degradation due to
            their excessive use of water in cooling their servers, but also because my
            family’s physical identities may be exploited for malicious purposes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Who wouldn’t want that for our loved ones, right?
          </p>

          <p>
            So, I started small. I tried warning my sister about the environmental
            consequences of continued AI use. <i>Well, I failed.</i>  
            She laughed off the thought.
          </p>

          <p className="font-semibold">
            However, this kind of conversation should not end with a shrug or a joke—there
            must be layers of discussion and a commendable change in behavior.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let’s approach people, starting with our family and neighbors, and extending to
            the online communities we often interact with. Let’s continue to speak up and
            have our voice heard by our elected leaders so they can take action.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let’s start the conversation and end it with purpose and compassion.
          </p>

          <p>
            In doing so, we wouldn’t need to pull people out from the pool and end their joy;
            we would only have to teach them how to swim and survive against its dangers.
          </p>
